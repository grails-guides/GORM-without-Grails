If you want to start from scratch, create a new Spring Boot application using
https://start.spring.io/[Spring Initializr].

Select a `Gradle Project` using `Groovy` with `Spring Boot 1.5.6`. Once you have selected
your build and project type, set the Group to your organization ie. `com.example` in our case
we will use `demo`. 

Once that is done add the `Web` and `h2` dependencies to the project.
